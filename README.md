# MLH-Ethical-Data
A Terminal App to monitor the data going in and out from your system.

# Reason Behind Creating MLH-Ethical-Data?
It's always important to see and know what type of server or port is running on your Local PC, so we came up with an idea to create a python program that helps people see and know what server or port is running on their Local PC. Since Ethical Data involves protecting your data and also know where your data is been used, it's a very nice imlementation from us.

# What Can MLH-Ethical-Data Do?
- Check open ports
- Close ports -- warnings for system ports
- Get a random fact about security concerns through ports
- Check the scope of accessibility of ports (not implemented yet but trying)

# How can MLH-Ethical-Data be used?
You just need to navigate to the directory and run python3 main.py
